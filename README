Requirements
------------
Java version 1.5 or newer (also known as 5.0).

Blackspirit Graphics requires two third-party libraries.

Vecmath:
A binary version of vecmath is bundled with every release and must be included in the classpath.

JOGL 1.1.1:
The JOGL library is available for various operating systems (including Windows, Linux and MacOSX).
As there is a JOGL package available for each operating system and for webstart applications
JOGL is not bundled with the release packages and must be downloaded from 'http://jogl.dev.java.net'.

The Jar archives from the JOGL distribution must be included in the classpath and
the native libraries (.dll or .so) must be made available for the application.
In Eclipse a native library path can be defined for each Jar archive.

Please notice that the Gluegen library (including native libraries) coming with JOGL 
is also needed.

Webstart
--------
I signed version of BSGraphics.jar is included with the distribution and can be used for webstart
applications.

Have a look at the jnlp files of the demos on 'http://www.blackspirit.ch' for an example of
how to set up a webstart application using Blackspirit Graphics.
